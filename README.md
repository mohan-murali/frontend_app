# Libraries Used

I am using the following Libraries with this app

- Prime React - Its a free and open sourced React component library. I am using this library to quickly create frequently used components and to make my app more presentatble.
- Prime Flex /Prime Icons - Its a free and open sourced CSS library. Combined with prime react, its used for creating and styling components quickly.
- Vite - Vite is a next gen front end tooling library. I am using it for fast build and running as well as for fast Hot module replacement and Typscript compilation.
